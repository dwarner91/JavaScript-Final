        <h3>1.  Identify a common JavaScript style guide, and hyperlink to it.</h3>
            <p><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html" target="blank">Google Javascript Style.</a></p>

        <h3>2.  Identify three distinct "best practice" programming practices and explain how they create better code.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use semicolons even when they can be skipped, due to the fact that there are instances where a line break is not interpreted as a semicolon.</li>
                <li>Try to avoid nesting levels that are too deep, this will help code readability for yourself and your peers.</li>
                <li>Write your code above your functions, as this will make it clearer what the code is used for, and may save time in reading functions.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>3.  Identify three distinct sloppy programming practices and explain the problems they each create.</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>Writing one-letter variables. These tend to vanish inside of walls of code, and be extremely difficult to locate when needed later on.</li>
            <li>Using abbreviations. This can make it difficult to understand what your code is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Using similar variable names. If you have two similar variable names, such as "ball" and "bald", it can make code very difficult to read. Also, a typo could potentially confuse your code if it interchanges one variable name for the other.</li>
           </ul>       

        <h3>4.  Explain the difference between a primitive, an array, and an object and include an example of each.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A primitive is a value of a primitive type, such as a string. A primitive can be used as though it were an object, but it still is not an object.</li>
                    
                <li>A normal object is incapable of manipulating the order of its elements. An array on the other hand is a type of object that allows us to do just that. An example of an array would be <br> <b>let toDoList = ["eat", "sleep", "videogames",];</b>.</li>

                <li>An object is capable of storing multiple values as properties. A function is an example of a type of object. An array is another type of object, one that is used to store a collection of ordered values.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>5.  Explain the phrase "Fractions divided by powers of 2 are exactly represented in the binary system" and what universal problem this is referring to in all programming languages?</h3>
        <p>In computers and programming languages, numbers are stored in memory in binary form. Because of this, any fraction that is not a power of 2 cannot be represented perfectly. For instance, neither 0.1 or 0.2 are negative powers of 2, therefore, they cannot be represented with complete accuracy in JavaScript.</p>
